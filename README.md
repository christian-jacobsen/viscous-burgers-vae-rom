# viscous-burgers-vae-rom

We want to develop a probabilistic ROM for viscous Burgers using VAEs.

- [x] First, begin with 1D and try to reconstruct single time snapshots rather than the entire spatio-temporal snapshot. 
- [x] Reconstruct single time snapshots over multiple initial conditions
- [ ] Extract dynamical system parameters from lower dimensional representation using hierarchical priors.
- [ ] Predict dynamical system from lower dimensional representation.
